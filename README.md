Interactive UI Menu Button

Last updated 05/20/2018

Hi! I'm currently working on creating a plugin for animating the menu button (a.k.a. hamburger button when user taps or clicks on it. This is my first project for interactive UI design / front-end development, and also my first open source project. I've just released version 0.2, and I'm currently developing it as I go. The end goal is to have a small library for the interactive menu button that can be easily plugin into bootstrap, or other custom websites. Stay tuned!
